;;; Commentary:

;; The very first initialization code Emacs runs. Used for lowlevel
;; optimizations and special settings.

;;; Code:

(setq
 site-run-file nil                         ; No site-wide run-time initializations.
 inhibit-default-init t                    ; No site-wide default library
 package-enable-at-startup nil)            ; We'll use straight.el

;; Tweak garbage collector to make startup faster.
;; See https://emacsconf.org/2023/talks/gc/
(setq gc-cons-threshold (* 80 1024 1024))

;; Reset garbage collector limit after the init process has ended (800Kb)
(add-hook 'after-init-hook
          #'(lambda () (setq gc-cons-threshold 800000)))

(setq native-comp-eln-load-path
      (list (expand-file-name "eln-cache" user-emacs-directory)))

;; Start Emacs maximixed without scrollbars
(setq default-frame-alist '((vertical-scroll-bars . 0)
                            (horizontal-scroll-bars . 0)
                            (tool-bar-lines . 0)))

;; During startup, Emacs doesn't require specific file handlers for every file
;; it opens or loads; thus, we should unset this list to optimize the startup process.
(defvar file-name-handler-alist-original file-name-handler-alist)
(setq file-name-handler-alist nil
      site-run-file nil)

;; No menu bar
(menu-bar-mode -1)

;;; early-init.el ends here
