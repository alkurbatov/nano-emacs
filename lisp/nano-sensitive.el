;;; Commentary:

;; Special minor mode to avoid backups of files with sensitive data.

;;; Code:

(define-minor-mode nano-sensitive-mode
  "For sensitive files like password lists.
It disables backup creation and auto saving.

With no argument, this command toggles the mode.
Non-null prefix argument turns on the mode.
Null prefix argument turns off the mode."

  ;; The initial value.
  :init-value nil
  ;; The indicator for the mode line.
  :lighter " Sensitive"
  ;; The minor mode bindings.
  :keymap nil

  (if (symbol-value nano-sensitive-mode)
      (progn
        ;; disable backups
        (set (make-local-variable 'backup-inhibited) t)
        ;; disable auto-save
        (if auto-save-default
            (auto-save-mode -1)))
                                        ;resort to default value of backup-inhibited
    (kill-local-variable 'backup-inhibited)
