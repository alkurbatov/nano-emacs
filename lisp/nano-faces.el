;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines the 6 basic nano faces several nano modules require:

;; - nano-face-critical  - nano-face-popout   - nano-face-salient
;; - nano-face-default   - nano-face-faded    - nano-face-subtle

;;; Code:

(defun nano-what-faces (pos)
  "Get the font faces at POS."
  (interactive "d")
  (let ((faces (remq nil
                     (list
                      (get-char-property pos 'read-face-name)
                      (get-char-property pos 'face)
                      (plist-get (text-properties-at pos) 'face)))))
    (message "Faces: %s" faces)))

(provide 'nano-faces)
